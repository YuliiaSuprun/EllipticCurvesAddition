# Elliptic Curves Addition

Elliptic curves are applicable for encryption, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks. Their main advantage is that they provide security equivalent to classical systems but use fewer bits. Elliptic curves are also used in several integer factorization algorithms that have applications in cryptography, such as Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization. <br >
For current cryptographic purposes, an elliptic curve is a plane curve over a finite field (rather than the real numbers) which consists of the points satisfying the equation:
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O_t=\text { $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$ } t " />
{\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b,\,}y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b,\,
along with a distinguished point at infinity, denoted âˆž. <br >
This program implements an "addition" operation of two points in elliptic curve.
